Vehicle speed detection is a critical component of various traffic management and road safety applications. The ability to accurately detect the speed of vehicles can help monitor traffic flow, enforce speed limits, and prevent accidents.

This project aims to develop a computer vision system that can detect the speed of moving vehicles in real-time. The system will be implemented using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python. The video footage of moving vehicles will be captured and processed frame by frame. Image processing techniques like background subtraction and object detection algorithms will be used to detect and track the moving vehicles.

In the pre-processing stage, the frames will be converted to grayscale and noise will be removed using Gaussian Blur. Background subtraction will be used to extract the foreground (i.e., the moving vehicles) from the frames. The contours of the vehicles will then be found using cv2.findContours and filtered based on size, shape, and aspect ratio.

Object tracking algorithms like Kalman filter or Meanshift will be used to track the vehicles as they move across multiple frames. The location information of the vehicles in each frame will be used to calculate their speed. The speed information will be displayed on the video frames or saved to a file for further analysis.

The project will require a good understanding of computer vision, image processing, and object tracking algorithms. Fine-tuning and experimentation will be necessary to achieve the desired level of accuracy and performance.

Upon completion, the system will provide valuable information for traffic management and road safety applications. It will be able to detect the speed of moving vehicles in real-time, making it an essential tool for monitoring traffic flow, enforcing speed limits, and preventing accidents.
